                Hi, I am a 20 years old student at optima and I am currently

              Hi, I am a 20 years old student at optima currently studying
              software development. At the age of 14, I watched a series
              entitled 24 hours. Among the characters in the movies, was a lady
              called Chloe Oâ€™Brian. She was an IT personel who was very good at
              her work. By watching how she used, what I callher super powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              was able to do the imagenable behind the screen(Her computers).
              There and then, I told myself that that is what I would like to do
              in the future. Work as a programmer. In the year 2019, I applied
              at an online school to study computer science. This enabled me
              grasp Some knowledge about python.
            </p>
            <p>
              A couple years later, I enrolled myself in Optima as a programmer.
              This is where I am currently learning web development. I am a
              curious person as far as learning is concerned. Hoping to develop
              a great community with you guys.
